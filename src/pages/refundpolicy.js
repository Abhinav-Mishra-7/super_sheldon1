1. Introduction
1.1 This Refund and Cancellation Policy (“Policy”) governs the terms under which
SuperSheldon (“we”, “our”, “us”, or the “Company”) will process cancellations,
refunds, and rescheduling requests for all educational programs, sessions, courses,
and services offered.
1.2 By enrolling in our courses, booking a class, subscribing to our platform, or using
any of our services, you (“Student”, “Parent”, or “User”) agree to this Policy.

2. General Principles
2.1 SuperSheldon is committed to providing world-class learning experiences across
global standards (UK, US, Australia) including NAPLAN, SAT, Selective Exams, 11+,
GCSE, and academic/non-academic 1:1 sessions.
2.2 Since we reserve teacher time slots, learning resources, and platform access for
every enrolled student, refunds and cancellations are subject to specific conditions
outlined below.

3. Cancellations by Students/Parents
3.1 Single Class / Trial Sessions:
- If a cancellation request is made 24 hours prior to the scheduled class, the session can be rescheduled free of cost.
- If cancelled within 24 hours, the class will be considered consumed and non-refundable.

3.2 Course/Program Enrollments:
- Cancellations made within 7 days of purchase and before the first class will be eligible for a 100% refund.
- Cancellations made after the first class but within 7 days of purchase will be eligible for a partial refund (course fee minus one class fee + administrative charges).
- No cancellations will be entertained after 7 days of purchase or once the student has attended more than 2 sessions.

4. Refund Conditions
4.1 Eligible Refunds will be processed in cases where:
- A technical failure or platform issue prevents the student from attending despite valid attempts.
- A class is cancelled by SuperSheldon without providing an alternative or rescheduling option.
- Duplicate payment has been made due to technical errors.

4.2 Non-Refundable Cases:
- Change of mind or lack of interest by student/parent.
- Non-attendance due to personal reasons (travel, other commitments).
- Failure to meet system requirements or internet connectivity issues on the student’s side.

5. Rescheduling Policy
5.1 Students may reschedule up to 2 classes per month with at least 24 hours’ notice.
5.2 Rescheduling is subject to teacher availability.

6. Course Transfers
6.1 A student may transfer their enrollment from one course/subject (e.g., Math to Science, Coding to Public Speaking) within 14 days of purchase, subject to availability.
6.2 Course fee differences (if any) must be settled at the time of transfer.

7. Refund Process & Timelines
7.1 All approved refunds will be processed within 7–14 working days via the original mode of payment.
7.2 SuperSheldon is not responsible for delays caused by banks, payment gateways, or third-party providers.

8. Company’s Right to Cancel
8.1 SuperSheldon reserves the right to cancel or reschedule any course/session in unforeseen circumstances (teacher unavailability, technical issues, or emergencies).
In such cases, students will be offered an alternative session or a 100% refund.

9. Grievance Redressal
9.1 Any concerns regarding cancellations or refunds must be raised to support@supersheldon.com within 7 days of the issue.
9.2 The Company will review and respond within 5 business days.

10. Final Disclaimer
10.1 SuperSheldon strives to provide best-in-class academic and extracurricular learning. However, refunds cannot be claimed for outcomes such as exam scores, grades, or personal achievements, as learning success also depends on student effort and commitment.
